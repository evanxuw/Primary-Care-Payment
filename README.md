# Primary Care Payment 

The purpose of the project is to develop a data pipeline to visualize primary care payment for the hospitals. 

## Description

Understanding revenue is paramount for the financial well-being of various hospitals/clinics/programs. Uncollected funds decrease resources available to patients.  In addition, different insurance systems and the various departments and cost centers create a blended reimbursement schedule that is often difficult to understand. Therefore, creating a system that is easily accessible to clinics and finance staff is essential. This project will be built in different phases. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* PowerBI, Python3, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18, Visio 

### Installing

* PowerBI- Desktop Version 

### Executing program

* Data Flow Diagram: visualize the data flow process: interative and iterative process to map out data flows in the system

* SQL Script to produce a CSV file that feeds into POWERBI for visualization ([Primary-Care-Payment/SQLFinalized.sql](https://github.com/evanxuw/Primary-Care-Payment/blob/main/SQLFinalized.sql))

* Python File to Clean up format- priority appt list (https://github.com/evanxuw/Primary-Care-Payment/blob/main/clean.py)

## Next Steps and bottlenecks
* We still need to work with clinics to figure out what operation issues clinics have before optimizing DB and developing a sophisticated modeling.
