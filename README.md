# Primary Care Payment 

The purpose of the project is to develop a data pipeline to visualize primary care payment for the hospitals. 

## Description

Understanding revenue is paramount for the financial well-being of various hospitals/clinics/programs. The financial class payor mix and the various departments and cost centers that make up Community Oriented Primary Care, Whole Person Integrated Care, Primary Care, and Specialty Care create a blended reimbursement schedule that is often difficult to understand outside of Finance and Accounting. Uncollected funds affect resources available to patients

## Next Steps and bottlenecks
* We still need to work with clinics to figure out what operation issues clinics have before optimizing DB and developing a sophisticated modeling.
